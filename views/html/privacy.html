    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>LocalResponse, Inc. (“LocalResponse”, “we”, “our”) offers a digital advertising platform that enables marketers to target advertising based upon a consumer’s approximate location. We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and protect information when you visit our website (the “Site”) or encounter the services (the “Services”) we provide to our advertising and publishing clients.</p>
    <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
    <p>
      The following is a list of the types of information we may collect and ways in which it is generally used:
      <br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Public Information. When you sign up for a social networking site or service such as Twitter, you may create a public profile that includes your name, some biographical information and the general area you may be located. You may choose not to share this information publicly by communicating this to the social networking site or service. Similarly, the information contained in Tweets and other social networking communications are generally public. If you want information on how to customize your settings via Twitter, for example,<a href='https://twitter.com/settings/account' target='_blank'>click here</a>. We may collect that information directly or via partners in order to help our clients customize marketing messages to you. For example, if you Tweet that you are at your local Kmart store, our Service may help Kmart mention you via what Twitter users typically refer to as an<a href='http://support.twitter.com/articles/14023' target='_blank'>@mention</a>. The @mention will typically be some kind of commercial message - announcing a discount or special offer. PLEASE NOTE: Data for accessing the internet and social networks such as Twitter over your mobile device, including Tweets you send or receive (whether or not initiated by our Service) may be imposed by your carrier.
      </li>
      <li>Website Logs. When visiting the Site, we automatically collect and store some information that you do not actively provide, such as your internet protocol (IP) address, software and hardware attributes such as browser type, the date and time of your visit, and the last website you visited which are used to enhance the services we provide to you.</li>
      <li>Cookies. We use cookies in connection with the Site and the Service. For the Site, we generally use cookies to help us understand how the Site is being utilized. For the Service, we may use cookies to deliver targeting advertising on websites that you visit. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can change your browser’s settings to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features and services will not function properly if cookies are disabled.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
    <p>
      We are careful to limit the information we share with our advertising and website publisher clients, our partners and third parties (collectively our “Business Partners”) to only that information that they need to have in order to help us provide the Service. Here are some examples of ways we share or otherwise disclose information:
      <br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For example, we may provide such information to Business Partners in connection with operating and maintaining the Site, fulfilling your requests for the Services, performing business and sales analysis, and offering contests or conducting surveys.</li>
      <li>If you have come to the Site (including a landing page we host on our Site on behalf of one of our clients) in response to an offer from a particular advertising client, we may share the information you provide with that advertiser. Sharing this Information may allow an advertiser to market directly to you should they choose to do so. While we inform our advertisers that they are only permitted to communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotion with LocalResponse, we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the advertiser, as the actions of the advertiser are not in our control.</li>
      <li>We may disclose any information we have if we have a good-faith belief that the disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, legal process or an enforceable government request; to enforce applicable terms of use for our services; to detect, prevent or otherwise address illegal activity, fraud, or security issues; or to protect the property or safety of our users, LocalResponse, or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
      <li>We may transfer information, including any personally identifiable information, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. If LocalResponse is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.</li>
      <li>We may share aggregated information with Business Partners and the general public, such as usage statistics or demographic trends regarding how you and others may interact with the Service.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ad Choices / Opting Out</h3>
    <p>We use tools such as frequency capping to help ensure that our Service doesn’t send too many messages to you. If you’d like to opt-out entirely from any @mentions of your Twitter handle generated by our Service, you may do so by following the instructions at the footer the landing page linked to in each message.</p>
    <p>
      LocalResponse is a member of the
      <a href='http://aboutads.info' target='_blank'>Digital Advertising Alliance</a>
      (“DAA”) and is in compliance with the<a href='http://aboutads.info' target='_blank'>DAA Self-regulatory Code</a>. We collect non-personally identifiable information to help us deliver relevant advertising via the Service. Some call this process interest-based advertising or online behavioral advertising. For more information about online behavioral advertising, please visit the<a href='http://aboutads.info' target='_blank'>DAA website</a>. If you’d like to understand your opt-out choices, please

    </p>
    <h3>Information Security</h3>
    <p>
      We are committed to industry best practices concerning security to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information in our possession. LocalResponse has implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information, both during transmission and once it is received. This includes but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure; therefore, while the company strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, it cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have any questions about these security practices, please email<a href='mailto:privacy@localresponse.com'>privacy@localresponse.com</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>How We Protect Children’s Privacy</h3>
    <p>We operate our Site and Service in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from anyone under 13.</p>
    <h3>Third Parties</h3>
    <p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you on the Site. If you follow links from our Site to another website, you should be aware that such sites will have their own privacy and data collection practices. LocalResponse has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies (and we may not even know what they are). For more information regarding any other website’s privacy policies, we encourage you to check that site.</p>
    <h3>General</h3>
    <p>
      We may amend this policy from time to time. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If your questions are not answered online, you may write to us at:
